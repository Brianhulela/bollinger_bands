In this repository, we explore the implementation of the **Bollinger Bands** strategy in Python, a popular technical analysis tool used in stock trading. The key objective of this project is to generate buy and sell signals based on the stock's price movements in relation to the Bollinger Bands, and simulate a basic trading strategy using these signals.

### Key Features:
- **Bollinger Bands Calculation**: We calculate the upper, lower, and middle Bollinger Bands using historical stock price data.
- **Signal Generation**: Buy and sell signals are generated when the stock price crosses above the upper band or below the lower band.
- **Backtest**: A simple backtesting framework to simulate buy/sell actions and track portfolio performance with brokerage fees.
- **Visualization**: Visual representation of the stock price, Bollinger Bands, and buy/sell signals using Matplotlib.
